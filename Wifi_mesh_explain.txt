Abstract:
            
            Here I used master slave concepts.Instead of painlessMesh.h library , here we used esp_now.h library .Master send data to 2 slave.
            If we using esp_now.h library , we need to know the mac address of the esp32.

Components: 

            1.3-ESP-32
            2.PIR sensor
            
Explanation:

           In this project it is a one way communication . The PIR sensor sense the moving object and return a output to the master esp32.the master 
           receive the output from PIR sensor it send a value 1 to the two slave ESP32 if the PIR doesn't send output,the Master send a value 0.In 
           slave if the received value is 1 the Inbuilt led turn ON .If the received value is 1 the Inbuilt led turn OFF.
